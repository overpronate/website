            Hi, My name is Nathanael! I have two and a half cats (one is a foster), and one 13 week doggo. I used to
            work as an Orthotist in the NHS, left and had a break, and now I'm starting a new career in software
            development. In my spare time I like to invent and build things, and you can often find me either in my shed
            workshop, or down at my allotment.

            <h2>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h2>

            <p>IT is vital to conducting business in the modern world; most all businesses today require an IT
                department to
                operate and compete in the market. You can break down the main areas used to internal and external,
                for
                instance
                companies will use IT for internal communications (email/video conferencing), file sharing
                (DropBox),
                collaborative working (Trello/Slack) etc. and they may also have a department dealing with reaching
                externally
                to customers through app development, engaging the public on social media platforms, and yet another
                protecting
                their and their customers’ assets with cyber security.

                Even aside from large corporations, almost all wages are process and paid through PAYE tax
                solutions, and
                most
                government services are accessed online, speeding up the processing of citizens’ applications,
                streamlining
                complex systems across departments, and allowing databases to be cross checked, reducing fraud etc.

                The ability to store large databases online has streamlined stock processing, tracking sales and
                therefore
                profits, and given birth to entire new sectors of industry and employment. Whilst jobs have been
                lost to
                automation in factories and data processing superseding scores of people manually processing
                paperwork,
                sectors
                have emerged in encryption and cyber security, 3D animation and design, and data processing can be
                reduced
                from
                days and weeks of pouring over raw data to plot trends, to the simple click of a button manipulating
                tables
                and
                producing infographics.</p>

            <h2>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources
                needed to complete digital projects successfully &ndash;
                what do you need to make projects successful?
                What tools? What skills?</h2>

            Aside from the obvious need to have stable and reliable access to computing equipment and internet, you
            need a
            way
            to plan and track the progress of your project, and if in a team communicating with your colleagues.
            Successfully
            working as a team can be made much easier with instantly collaborative programs such as Trello and Jira,
            open
            communication such as Stand Ups, and having a team structure massively aids its productivity, and
            prevents
            stepping
            on each others cyber toes. In a team, having a broad range of specialties and skills can be beneficial;
            there is
            no
            point in 10 back end developers and no
            front end, or 50 programmers and no team lead. Depending on the scope of the project, you may need team
            members
            with
            image manipulation/video editing skills, server management, or representatives from industry you are
            producing
            the
            project for.
            Having all of your work uploaded and accessible on the cloud means that all members can access it
            regardless of
            location and timezone, and have up to date copies; the common industry standard being GitHub, Google
            Documents,
            or
            DropBox.

            <h2>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT &ndash; e.g. making
                your website.
                How will you plan it? Include a link to
                your trello board.</h2>


            I planned my blog project by deciding what content I wanted, how I wanted it to look, and what skills I
            wanted
            to
            learn. This was broken down into tasks, and I used a Trello board to organise them, which can be
            accessed here:
            https://trello.com/b/X0j9PMKV/blog.

        <div id="question-4" class="question">
            <h2>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital
                projects &ndash; what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h2>

            For a project to run to completion, and delivered on time, you need sufficient funding, staffing, and
            premises.
            Withdrawal of funds/market crashes, staff shortages, or eviction from rented offices would derail most
            projects.

            Poor understanding, or dramatic change, of the target market could ruin a project’s success. Examples of
            this
            would
            include not understanding how the digital project will be used, misjudging market size, and
            misunderstanding who
            and
            what your competitors are.

            Finally poor communications and bad management. In order for a project to succeed it requires many
            parties to
            come
            together in agreement about how the project should progress. Miscommunication can lead to
            misunderstanding
            between
            two parties, whether it is between coworkers, client, or staff. Bad management can have the single
            biggest
            influence
            on any projects success, with staff being willing to weather most storms for a good manager.

        <div id="question-5" class="question">
            <h2>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting
                and using IT systems and software &ndash;
                how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h2>
            While using the optimal tool for the job is ideal, familiarity is worth a significant amount when
            weighing up
            the
            pros and cons of one set of tools, and as such I will use Trello to plan out my project, Slack to
            communicate
            with colleagues, and GitHub to store my files oline. Stability, community, and support are all extremely
            valuable, especially when
            starting out. You never want to be the biggest fish using a tool if you can help it, shouldering
            yourself with
            the
            burdens on maintenance and new arising problems that haven’t been encountered by others. It is worth
            considering
            the
            longevity of both the project and the technology, balancing cutting edge/emerging technology as well as
            the
            budget
            you have to work with.
        </div>


        <div id="question-6" class="question">
            <h2>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your
                chosen technologies have helped you achieve
                your outcomes. How has trello helped you plan
                and how can git and GitHub help with your codes
                version control?</h2>
            As a visual person, I have found Trello a natural digital progression of planning with sticky notes,
            with the
            added
            benefit of being able to access it anywhere, and work with input from other people. What you lose from
            the
            visceral
            satisfaction of crumpling up a completed task, you gain in being able to retrieve archived items,
            labels, and
            being
            able to rearrange tasks to your hearts content.

            For any long lived project maintaining a history of changes is essential. Git provides an interface for
            doing
            this
            that is much more powerful than creating “copy 1”, “copy 2”, etc. of a project. Additionally git and
            github
            provide
            tools for collaborating with others; for sharing code, and making contributions to a project in readable
            and
            reviewable chunks.

        <div id="question-7" class="question">
            <h2>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that
                impact digital projects &ndash;
                How does GDPR impact
                digital projects?</h2>
            With the very essence of the internet being global, you need to be aware of major legislation in
            different
            countries
            to be able to provide an international product. The most widespread examples of these are COPPA,
            requiring age
            verification, CAN-SPAM, regulating commercial emails and the consumers rights to unsubscribe from their
            mailing
            list, and GDPR, regulating the way that personal data can be used and shared, and the timespan it can be
            stored
            for.

            <h2>Review</h2>
            <p>I am relatively happy with my webpage, though I am looking forward to working on it further and
                integrating
                more functions and pages. I would have liked to use the Dyslexie font to make the text more readable for
                people with dyslexia, but it was outside of my budget to purchase a font. The images are labeled so that
                software for those with low vision can describe their contents.</p>

            <p>Inevitably, I struggled to stay on task, and was often distracted by all the new and shiny things to
                learn and try, only some of which worked. In future I would try to use Trello in more detail, breaking down my
                tasks into smaller chunks, and hopefully use it to keep me on task and provide that sense of
                acheivement.</p>

            <p>With the exception of the Facebook and Github logos, all the content was written by myself, and whilst I
                looked at others' blogs for design inspiration, nothing was copied or lifted. The logos are copyrighted,
                and
                belong to Facebook and Github respectively.</p>
